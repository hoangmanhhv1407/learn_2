<br>
Player Kill Mode (PK) means that you do not have to request a Duel to begin 
combat with another player, so you can virtually attack any player within range 
without warning. <p>
You can log into 9Dragons on a designated Player Killer Server where the entire 
map is a PK zone, or a Pleasant Server where dueling rules apply and PK only 
exists in&nbsp; areaes Such as Bloody Plain, Nanchang, Hangzhou, etc.<p>
On every Pleasant Server there is a special location in the game exclusively for 
PK. It is called Bloody Plain, and it is where the final Duel of Nine Dragons 
was fought. In this location you can PK with anyone apart from members of your 
own clan or party. If you wish to fight members of your own clan you will need 
to wear a mask.
<p>
However, if the mask is removed by another player using their Revealing Hands 
Technique then for a limited period of time you will be given &quot;Clan Public 
Enemy&quot; status and can be attacked without restricition.<br><br>
