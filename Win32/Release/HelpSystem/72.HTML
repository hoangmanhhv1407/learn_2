<br><font size=4pt>¡¡</font><font size=8pt> A Hero Band is a group formed by 
members of the same clan who wish to share their fortune and destiny for a time.<br>
Within the band there is a Hero Band Leader (who has either created the band or 
been appointed by a former Leader) and several normal members.<br>
¿µHero Bands have the advantage of convenient systems like special pigeongrams 
and hero announcements. You will find that many hands make light work, 
especially when it comes to attacking powerful monsters.<br>
<br>
<b>Creating a Hero Band</b><br>
In order to form a Hero Band, you need to have achieved Cheng 1 of Raising Light 
and to have finished the Road Of Heroes quest.<br>
After completing the Road Of Heroes quest, you can talk to the clan¡¯s NPC in 
charge of creating Hero Bands.<br>
To do this, you will need at least five members to become the founding members 
and a specified amount of Contribution Points.<br>
Only a Party Leader has the right to create a Hero Band, and the Party Leader 
will automatically become the Hero Band Master.<br>
You are free to name the Hero Band anything you wish (within reason and good 
taste). But be warned, it cannot be renamed unless it is first disbanded and 
reformed.<br>
<br>
<b>Joining a Hero Band</b><br>
In order to join a Hero Band, you need to be invited by the acting Leader or the 
Master. The Leader is the designated player character who is currently in charge 
of the Hero Band and the Master is the player who initially formed the Hero 
Band. <br>
Only the Hero Band Leader and Master are authorized to invite others. Once you 
accept an invitation from a Leader or Master you will be registered as a Member.<br>
Once you become a Member, you will be automatically registered in the community 
window. You can press the [V] key to view information about your Hero Band and 
its Members.<br>
<br>
<b>Hero Announcement</b><br>
Hero Announcement is an announcement made within a Hero Band.<br>
The Leader and Master are authorized to write Announcements. They can do so by 
clicking [Write] and [Edit] buttons.<br>
The Announcement will be shown to all Hero Band Members.<br>
<br>
Hero Pigeongram refers to Pigeongrams meant for all Hero Band Members.<br>

When sending a Pigeongram, enter &quot;@HERO BAND NAME&quot; in the &quot;receiving&quot; section to 
send Pigeongrams to all members of the Hero Band.<br>
Hero Pigeongrams are written in green to distinguish them from regular 
Pigeongrams.<br>
