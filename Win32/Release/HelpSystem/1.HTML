<br><font size=4pt>　</font><font size=8pt> In 9Dragons you will be able to play 
the role of a fantastic character with unique characteristics and undetermined 
potential. You can generate up to three of these characters and customize them 
as you wish.<br>
<br>
When you create a new character you will choose a starting city. New characters 
are however still considered neutral regardless of this choice, without 
alliegance to any faction or clan. They are referred to as Vagabonds.<br>
<img src=1.jpg align=left width="133" height="232"><br>

Your new character knows no Kung Fu or meditation techniques. You should equip 
them as soon as possible if you wish them to survive and thrive against the 
hardships of The Land .<br>
A Vagabond is any player character who does not belong to a clan. This could be 
because they have not yet chosen one or, at higher levels, because they have 
been expelled from one. There are Sifus (teachers) who will teach you Kung Fu 
techniques as a Vagabond. However, these skills are quite weak compared to the 
Kung Fu techniques you can learn from clan masters.<br>
<br>
Each clan has it's own unique combat techniques that you can only learn once you 
have joined a clan. After gaining the confidence of your Clan Elders, you will 
eventually be given a chance to learn even greater Kung Fu by specializing in 
one of 4 clan specific classes or Roles that offer different styles of play. The 
Clan Elders will then show you the basic Kung Fu or Chi Kung techniques that 
your selected Role can learn. There are higher level techniques available but 
you will need to raise your level of achievement before the Clan Elders will 
reveal them to you.<br>
<br>
Each clan has it's own base or stronghold. This is where clan members can eat, 
sleep, gather and train. The leaders of the clans reside here and will sometimes 
offer opportunities for advancement.<br>
Clan leaders may offer great wisdom, compete with each other in contests, brag 
about the strength of their clan and even take out their vengence on those who 
offend them! Their primary goal, however, is to recruit strong new disciples to 
rebuild their clan following the devastating War of Nine Dragons.<br>
<br>
There are many ways to make a living in The Land. You can sell any items you 
might find to the various merchants scattered throughout. However, the prices 
that these merchants will offer you are only a fraction of what they are really 
worth. To get the best prices many players offer their items to other players by 
opening up a personal shop, called a Stand, and setting their own price. <br>
<br>
While it is true that you could gain riches just by selling items to stores, 
your Clan Elders also expect you to contribute wealth to the clan. Sell and 
trade items with your fellow disciples, and make Clan Contributions to the Clan 
Elders of your clan when possible. Donating items to your Clan Elders will often 
reward you with Clan Contribution Points, which you will need to trade for the 
priviledge of learning clan Kung Fu. <br>
<br>
Remember that the aftermath of The War of Nine Dragons has generated much 
poverty and hardship in The Land. </font>
<p><font size=8pt>Those in need can be found on every street corner. The elderly 
need assistance to travel, parents seek lost children, and vendettas abound. 
Helping others brings one good karma as well as Experience in </font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>The Land, and Experience leads to mastery. </font></p>
<p>　</p>
<p><font size=8pt>One may also find that the most precious rewards come from 
simple acts of kindness.</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>How To Gain Experience </font>
</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><font size=8pt>A completed quest brings with it Experience, as does victory 
over an opponent. After gaining enough Experience, one finds that they have 
suddenly increased in their level (Cheng) of mastery. As you raise your Cheng 
you will find you are stronger, faster, and less easily injured. One of the best 
ways to gain Experience is to join a group of fellow warriors who share your 
allegiance. If you find several people who have embarked on the same quest as 
you, you will find your path becomes much easier to walk.</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>By the way, the number nine is considered especially lucky. So 
good things may happen to a band of nine people.</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>Stronger than a general group is a Hero Band. This is a group 
of players who are all from the same clan, and they can embark on special Hero 
Band quests together, sharing Experience and Rewards as they travel. In the 
battles between the clans the smallest clan unit is called a Hero Band.</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>The most important form of advancement you should pursue is 
the development of your Kung Fu and weapon skills. Learning a Kung Fu technique 
is only the beginning of your journey. To be effective you need to practice your 
techniques in actual combat. Mastering an individual Kung Fu technique makes it 
far more powerful.</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>&nbsp;While techniques improve with use, your Kung Fu Weapon 
Mastery will be able to rise with Experience just as your character does. Each 
time your character ascends to a higher level (cheng) they are given one Mastery 
Point, which you can add to the mastery skill of your choice.</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>&quot;Empty hand&quot; Kung Fu is greatly praised, but if you wish to 
master a weapon you will need to foster your Kung Fu Skills, your achievement 
level, and your Weapon Mastery Points. There is an ancient proverb that says 
&quot;The edge of a skilled butcher's knife needs little sharpening&quot;. This is 
important, because if you use weapons that are &quot;beyond your ability&quot; you are 
likely to wear them down quickly, if not destroy them entirely.</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>You can create up to three characters per account in 9Dragons, 
and each one can belong to any clan you choose (provided they meet the 
qualifications).</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>Safe journey and may the seeds of The Dragon within you 
thrive!</font></p>
