<br><font size=4pt>　</font><font size=8pt> If your Life bar falls to zero you 
will enter a state called Near-Death. Should this happen, pray for 
enlightenment.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>While Near-Death you will eventually fall into a state 
called Coma. If you are in a group with friends, then one of them can revive you 
from your Coma by quickly DOUBLE-CLICKING upon you and sharing their Chi. This 
technique is called Reviving Chi Kung. You too can apply your Chi to assist 
those who are Near-Death by administering your own Reviving Chi Kung with a 
DOUBLE-CLICK. This can prevent you from having to return great distances should 
you choose to revive elsewhere. If a friend revives you on the spot you will 
lose more experience than if you revive at your Clan Base or at an Inn.<br>
<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Coma state means you will lose various amounts of 
Experience Points and then revive at the location of your choice.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Revival on the spot where you lay Dying costs you more 
Experience Points than reviving at an Inn or at your Clan Base. So choose your 
place of revival with care, rather than upon impulse.<br><br>
