There are four types of Duels: Free Duel, Individual Duel, Group Duel, and
Duel Competitions. Here are their characteristics.<br>
<br>
<b>[Free Duel]</b><br>
After paying an entry fee in gold to a Duel Master, you can engage in Duels
at the Duel Grounds without any prior agreements. You can also have Duels
while joined in a Party.<br>
<br>
<b>[Individual Duel]</b><br>
These Duels require the agreement of both individuals. The Duel takes place
on a smaller Duel Ground.<br>
<br>
<b>[Group Duels]</b><br>
These Duels are started with the agreement of Party Leaders. Battle <span
class=SpellE>Royales</span> and Leader Battles are staged in Large Duel
Grounds. In smaller Duel Grounds, Multiple Rounds or Single Rounds can be
fought.<br>
<u>Battle Royale is a type of Group Duel that will only end when everyone in
one group has been killed.</u><br>
<u>Leader Battles are similar to Battle <span class=SpellE>Royales</span> but
they end when the leader of one group has been killed.</u><br>
<u>In Multiple Rounds, two teams engage in one-on-one combat in an agreed
order. The winner of one round stays on to fight the next challenger.</u><br>
<u>In Single Rounds, two teams engage in one-on-one combat in an agreed
order. The number of winners will determine the outcome.</u><br>
<br>
<b>[Duel Competition]</b><br>
This is a large-scale Duel. The final winner will be given an Epithet, <span

better</span></p>
