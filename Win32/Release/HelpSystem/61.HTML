Elixers<br>
Elixirs are consumable medicines that are rumored to have a permanent effect on 
one's capabilities, or to even bring back the dead. They can be created from 
herbs or from some other mysterious ingredients using ancient, secret methods. 
Elixirs have been discovered for Strength, Essence, Wisdom, Constitution, and 
Dexterity.
<br><br>
Elixirs do not always work and their effects are often random.<br>
Sometimes Elixirs may have unforseen side effects. They are affected by your 
physical constitution and blind luck.<br>
You should make sure that you are in a safe location before consuming an Elixir.<br>
<br>
If you have had bad luck with an Elixir then you may possibly return to your 
original state by taking another one.<br>
<font color=indianred>After consuming an Elixir, other Elixirs of the same level 
or lower can be retaken freely.<BR></font>
By retaking Elixirs of the same level you can regain any capability you might 
have lost. And then take it's own effect, which may or may not be beneficial. 
Each level of Elixir has a different maximum amount of bonus.<br>
<br>
You can maximize an Elixir's effects through the use of Supplementary Elixirs.<br>
<br>
<b>Supplementary Elixirs</b><br>
These specialized medicines remove the side effects of Elixirs and maximize 
their effectiveness.<br>
<br>
For best results you need to take the Supplementary Elixir first.<br>
<br>
There are Neutralizers that can cancel out the side effects from Elixirs, 
Softeners that help taking the Elixirs, and Fortifiers that can maximize the 
effects.<br>
