<br><font size=4pt>　</font><font size=8pt> Kung Fu techniques can be learned 
from either a Sifu at a local Martial Arts School or from a Clan Master.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>In order to learn Kung Fu techniques from a Clan Master 
you will need to have the required <a href=6.html>Clan Contribution</a> Points 
and achievement levels for the technique you wish to learn. Gain Clan 
Contribution Points from a Clan Elder by donating useful items to your clan. 
Check the technique's requirements by double-clicking any technique offered in a 
menu by a Sifu or Clan Master.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Once you have learned a Kung Fu technique, you will still 
need to <a href=15.html>train</a> it before you can successfully use it in 
combat..<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>In some instances, Kung Fu knowledge can be absorbed 
through the reading of special books called Tomes. If you should be so lucky as 
to discover such a Tome, see if you can read it and you may discover that you 
have learned some new Kung Fu.<br><br>
