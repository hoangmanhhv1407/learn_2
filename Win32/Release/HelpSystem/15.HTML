<br><font size=4pt>¡¡</font><font size=8pt> Different types of Kung Fu require 
different training methods.<br>

<br>
Kung Fu skills can be trained at a local Martial Arts School or at a Clan's Kung 
Fu Training Ground. Once you have learned a Kung Fu technique, make sure you are 
equipped with the correct type of weapon, seek out a training dummy, and attack 
it as you would an opponent.<br>

<br>
Rounding, Channeling, and Casting skills can be trained at a Chi Kung Training 
Ground. Once you have learned a Chi Kung technique, enter the training ground, 
settle into a meditative pose, free your mind and concentrate on the revolving 
target.<br>

without any training.</font><font size=8pt><br>
<br>
<font size=4pt>¡¡</font>Kung Fu training begins when you double-click on a 
training dummy. During the course of training, you will learn to unlock all 
three related moves of a technique. Once completed you will be able to use the 
technique against your opponents in The Land. But know that training is much 
different than real world experience, Grasshopper. At first you will only be 
capable of delivering the first move.<br><br>
