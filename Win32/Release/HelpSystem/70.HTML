(Adding Ornaments can give items many desirable attributes.)<br>
<br>
Ornamentation refers to attaching Ornaments to weapons or clothes to gives those 
items heightened functionality. Anyone can learn to attach ornaments but making 
the Clasps to attach ornaments (or remove ornaments that are already attached) 
can only be done by skilled craftsmen.<br>
These skilled craftsmen will ask for payment and certain raw Materials to make 
the clasps for ornamentation. There is also a chance that their work will fail, 
and if it does then the weapons / clothes and materials may be destroyed.<br>
<br>
<b>Additional Clasps / Pockets</b><br>
If you wish to have additional clasps or pockets added to your weapons or 
clothes then these same skilled craftsmen can do that as well. The possibility 
remains that their work will fail, and if it does then the weapons / clothes and 
materials may be destroyed.<br>
<br>
<b>Removing Ornaments</b><br>
The craftsman will charge a fee to return an item to it's original state, but 
know that this process will destroy the Ornaments. For an additional fee and 
some extra materials, the Ornaments can be seperated and used again.<br>
There is also a risk of failure when seperating Ornaments.<br><br>
