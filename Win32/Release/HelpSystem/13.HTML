Using Kung Fu

<br><font size=4pt>　</font><font size=8pt> To perform Kung Fu you must first 
switch from Peace Mode to Combat Mode.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>You will repeat a basic Kung Fu technique on a selected 
target unless you cancel it. To use a Charged Kung Fu Technique, press the 
shortcut key and you will see your Vital Energy flowing as you power up. Once 
you release the key your charge will be cast. Most Charged Kung Fu techniques 
require a cooldown period before they can be recast.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Smashing Kung Fu techniques are more powerful than Active 
Kung Fu techniques and work in the same manner as Charged Kung Fu techniques. 
They have specified cooldown times and once you have used them you will then 
revert to your last Active Kung Fu technique.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Finishing Kung Fu techniques are the only long range Kung 
Fu moves available to warriors. Pressing the shortcut key will power up these 
techniques and once you release the key your charge will be cast. Please note 
that Finishing Kung Fu techniques cannot be used if the enemy has closed within 
a certain range.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Rounding Chi Kung techniques, like palm blasts, are 
favored by Chi Kung users because they cast instantly and require no cooldown 
time. Casting Chi Kung techniques, which may be even more powerful than Rounding 
Chi Kung techniques, take longer to cast and require cooldown periods. Pressing 
the shortcut key will power up these techniques and once you release the key 
your charge will be cast. Channelling Chi Kung techniques are similar to 
Rounding Chi Kung techniques because they cast instantly. Though once begun, the 
Channeling Chi Kung technique will be cast continuously until it is cancelled or 
until the caster's store of Vital Energy is depleted.
