<br><font size=4pt>　</font><font size=8pt> There are two types of wound that you 
can receive in 9Dragons, Internal and External.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Untreated External Wounds prevent you from recovering 
your full amount of Life during meditation, and Internal Wounds have the same 
effect on your recovery of Vital Energy. The seriousness of your wounds are 
shown as numbers to the right of both your Life (red) and Vital Energy (blue) 
bars.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>To treat your wounds and recover full Life or Vital 
Energy you will need to request aid from an NPC Doctor at a Clinic, use items 
which can be purchased from them, or seek a player with advanced healing skills.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Wounds occur in combat following Critical Hits from 
opponents, or from being attacked during meditation or Chi Breathing.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Some monsters excel at inflicting wounds rather than 
damage, so be on guard at all times.
