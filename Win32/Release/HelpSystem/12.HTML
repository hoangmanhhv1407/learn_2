Kung Fu is a martial art that allows 
the artist to summon one's vital energy to perform feats of combat that are far 
beyond the capabilities of an untrained warrior.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>You can check how many Kung Fu techniques you know by 
opening up your Kung Fu window (Shortcut Key:S). Kung Fu techniques you have 
trained appear in color, and may be placed into a toolbar quickslot with a right 
click. Any Kung Fu moves that you have learned, but have not yet trained at a 
training ground, will be depicted as grey icons.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>If you click on a Kung Fu icon you will get a description 
of its combat specifications and additional requirements.<br>
<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Levels of Kung Fu are called Cheng. The more you use a 
certain Kung Fu technique the better you will become at it. Raise the Cheng of 
your Kung Fu by using it to defeat opponents and you will quickly see evidence 
of this.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Active Kung Fu techniques are those techniques you can 
learn that consist of three moves when mastered, but only one upon completion of 
your training. You will be able to perform the first move of the technique as 
soon as you learn the skill. When you reach Cheng 3 and Cheng 5 of each 
technique, you will unlock, and automatically execute, the second and third 
moves of the technique as you witnessed them during your training. Once 
activated, an Active Kung Fu technique remains the attack of choice until 
manually discontinued.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>Chi Kung skills, which utilize Vital Energy for healing 
or for long distance attacks, will also gain power and evolve as your Cheng 
(skill level) increases.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>You may choose to limit an otherwise advanced technique 
to either the first move or the first two moves. The desired number of moves can 
be set or re-set by using the small arrow buttons located beneath a technique 
that is registered in a quickslot, to the left or right side of the technique's 
Cheng (skill level) indicator.<br>
