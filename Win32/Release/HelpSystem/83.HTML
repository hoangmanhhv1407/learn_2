You can pay any town's Doctor to heal your internal or external wounds, and he 
can also sell you treatments which will allow you to heal yourself while you are 
traveling.
<br><br>
Each time you travel you run the risk of being wounded in battle. External 
wounds will lessen your Life and internal wounds will reduce your Vital Essence. 
Unless these wounds are treated and healed you will not be able to raise your 
Life or Vital Energy to their maximum scores.<br>
Consume a self-treatment or visit a Doctor at a local Clinic to have your wounds 
healed.
