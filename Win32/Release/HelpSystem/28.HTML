<br><font size=4pt>　</font><font size=8pt> There are many different types of 
weapons to be found in The Land. One can use any weapon that one finds but 
without mastery over that type of weapon, it shall provide little attack power.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>There are many prerequisites to handling a weapon (level, 
dexterity, strength, training and mastery). If you do not meet the correct 
conditions then the durability of the weapon is drastically reduced and you will 
be unable to utilize it's full potential.<br>
<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>There are rankings for weapons that are dependant on 
craftsmanship, design and construction material. For example: Short Staffs are 
normally weaker than Bamboo Staffs, but Superior Short Staffs are stronger than 
Bamboo Staffs.<br>
<font size=4pt>　</font>You can attach <a href=38.html>ornaments</a> (grips, 
embroidery and tassels) to certain special weapons. These will improve the 
capabilities of the weapon. All weapons have a Durability Score and if this 
score is reduced to zero then the weapon is destroyed.
