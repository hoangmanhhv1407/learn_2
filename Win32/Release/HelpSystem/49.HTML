[Brief]<br>
If the other player is not willing to give out information then you can only see 
their basic stats.<br>
In this case, the information on other players will be displayed in three 
degrees of information, dependant upon the difference in levels between you and 
your target.<br>
<br>
[Equipment]<br>
If you are both willing it is possible to show the data on your Equipment to 
each other.<br>
This information is also displayed in three levels, and what you can see depends 
on the level difference.<br>
<br>
[Attributes]<br>
Players can also choose to show their Attributes.<br>
There are 3 varying stages of detail for Attributes as well.<br>
