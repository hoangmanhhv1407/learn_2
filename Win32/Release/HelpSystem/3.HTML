<b>Life</b><br>
The most precious gift you have is your own Life, cherish it!</font><p>
<font size=8pt>Your Life is depicted by the Red Bar onscreen. If your Red Bar 
reaches zero points then you will reach </font><font size="8pt"> <a href=#>near 
death state</a></font><font size=8pt>.</font><font size=8pt><br>
Every character's amount of Maximum Life is different, and is dependent on many 
factors, from how you disperse your Chi Points to special healing ornaments you 
may carry with you. Constitution is the strongest critical statistic that 
effects the amount of a character's Maximum Life. Points deducted against your 
Maximum Life from External Wounds will reduce Maximum Life replenishment during 
meditation, but may be healed with special herbs or by consulting a doctor at a 
nearby clinic.<br>
<br>
Vital Energy<br>
Vital Energy is internal energy, also called &quot;Chi&quot; that you gather into your 
body from the world around you, and from all living things, that you can summon 
and use to energize your abilities. You need Vital Energy to be able to perform 
most Kung Fu (physical attack) and Chi Kung (Energy attack) techniques. Martial 
Arts Masters have been known to use their great reserves of Vital Energy to 
perform what can only be described as superhuman feats.<br>
The more complex the Kung Fu or Chi Kung technique, the more Vital Energy it 
takes to perform it and the more damage (or healing) that it can inflict.</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>


Unlike Life, Vital Energy does not replenish itself over time. To recover your 
Vital Energy you need to meditate and reconnect yourself to The Land.<br>

Strength<br>
Your Strength score is an indication of how physically strong you are as a 
character.<br>
Your Strength determines your physical attack, defense and balance when 
performing Kung Fu.<br>
Strength is also a determining factor in the weapons you can use. You cannot do 
much damage with a sword if you are too weak to lift it.<br>
<br>
Essence<br>
Essence is the culmination of your Chi and is a determining factor of your level 
of Vital Energy.<br>
The more Vital Energy you have the longer you can execute your Kung Fu and Chi 
Kung techniques before reaching exhaustion. Once you have depleted your Vital 
Energy, you will become as weak as a kitten. You must meditate to revitalize 
your Vital Energy. <br>
<br>
Wisdom<br>
Wisdom is the culmination of your intellectual abilities and effects how well 
you learn lessons.<br>
Having a high degree of Wisdom allows that your Balance, Attack Power, Chi Kung 
Damage and Dodge are all higher because of your greater comprehension of all 
your techniques.<br>
<br>
Constitution<br>
Constitution is a measure of how healthy, robust and durable you are. A person 
with a robust Constitution can cope with a great deal more damage than a lesser 
being.<br>
Your constitution level is a determining factor of your Maximum Life Score.<br>
The higher your constitution the higher your Maximum Life Score and the greater 
your ability to recover from damage recieved.<br>
<br>
Dexterity<br>
Dexterity is the level of speed and agility you can utilize to carry out complex 
Kung Fu techniques.</font></p>
<p><font size=8pt>


A highly dexterous person has a greater success rate to both Strike and Dodge 
physical attacks. It also increases ones chance of making a Critical Strike 
against an opponent.<br>
