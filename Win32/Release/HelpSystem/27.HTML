<br><font size=4pt>모</font><font size=8pt> The Land is filled with many 
different types of items, some valuable, others priceless, many worthless. All 
of them (except quest items) can be put in or taken out of an inventory bag or 
storage facility by dragging them with the mouse.<br>
<font size=4pt>모</font>Right clicking on clothes and weapons will equip them. 
Right clicking on consumables, such as food or elixirs, will immediately consume 
them.<br>
<font size=4pt>모</font>All Clothing and Weapons have a Durability Score. If this 
score falls to zero then the item is destroyed. To prevent this from happening 
you should repair your items regularly.<br><br>

Item Ranking<br>
Items are ranked by their scarcity and function.<br>

<table bgcolor=#000000 width=98%><tr><td>
<font color=#AAAAAA size=8pt>뫠 Normal Items<font color=#ffffff>: These are 
readily available for purchase from normal Merchants or dropped by disciples of 
Deviant Clans. </font><br><br>
<font color=#87C9F9>뫠 Precious Items<font color=#ffffff>:  </font></font></font>
<font color=#FFFFFF size=8pt>These items are superior to normal items. If you 
are lucky you may find one. They can also be bought from the black market. Black 
Market Merchants typically hide their whereabouts and cannot be spotted through 
the mini-map.</font><font color=#AAAAAA size=8pt><font color=#87C9F9><br><br>
<font color=#3B92FF>뫠 Precious Items of The Land<font color=#ffffff>:  </font>
</font></font></font>
<font color=#FFFFFF size=8pt>These are even rarer than precious items, and are 
karmically connected to The Land's well-being.</font><font color=#AAAAAA size=8pt><font color=#87C9F9><br><br>
<font color=#FFCC00>뫠 Artifacts<font color=#ffffff>:  </font></font></font>
</font>
<font color=#FFFFFF size=8pt>These are exceptionally rare. You would be very 
lucky if you found one of these items and it could bring a great price if one 
were to sell it.</font><font color=#AAAAAA size=8pt><font color=#87C9F9><br><br>
<font color=#75B93A>뫠 Masterpiece<font color=#ffffff>:  </font></font></font>
</font>

<font color=#B279C8>뫠 Set Items<font color=#ffffff>:  </font></font></font>
</font>
<font color=#FFFFFF size=8pt>These are items that belong together. Individually 
they are not very useful, but if combined they can become quite powerful. Set 
Items may be weapons, clothes or accessories.</font><font color=#AAAAAA size=8pt><font color=#87C9F9><br><br>
<font color=#FF7800>뫠 The Jade Tablet of Nine Dragons<font color=#ffffff>:  </font>
</font></font></font>
<font color=#FFFFFF size=8pt>Legends tell of the Duel Of Nine Dragons, a mighty 
battle between the champions of each major clan that effectively ended The War 
of Nine Dragons. Although the Dragons themselves have long since disappeared, 
there are whispers that 9 lost pieces of jade, each part of a greater whole, 
have been scattered across The Land. It is further said that each piece bears 
the mark of one of the lost nine clan Dragons, and that each one has been 
magically imbued with untold power.</font><font color=#AAAAAA size=8pt><font color=#87C9F9>
