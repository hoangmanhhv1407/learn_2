<br><font size=4pt>¡¡</font><font size=8pt> This is a dreadful place filled with 
everything vile and it is highly recommended that you avoid it all together. No 
one sane would dare venture here. You have been forewarned by The Hermit.<br>
Each of the Deviant Clans has a main clan base (such as Death Valley or the 
Valley of Hell). If you can collect at least three relics from one of these clan 
bases you can use them to open up the Dungeon of Life and Death. You must place 
at least three relics on the altar in front of the clan base.<br>
<br>
The Party Leader decides when to make the attempt to enter the dungeon.<br>
<br>
The Dungeon of Life and Death has many descending levels, each fraught with 
ascending levels of danger.<br>
If you use the <font color="#FF0000">red bell relics</font> you will enter the 
dungeon on &quot;difficult&quot; setting,<br>
If you use the <font color="#008000">green bell relics</font> you will enter the 
dungeon on &quot;medium&quot; setting,<br>
If you use the <font color="#FF00FF">purple bell relics</font> you will enter 
the dungeon on &quot;easy&quot; setting.<br>
If you enter the dungeon on difficult setting there is a small percentile chance 
that you will activate the High Rewards Setting.
