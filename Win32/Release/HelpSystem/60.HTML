<br><font size=4pt>¡¡</font><font size=8pt> There are many basic necessities you 
will require as you travel, among them eating, drinking, lodging, and 
meditation¡¦ but perhaps nothing is more essential in this dangerous world then 
learning some strong Kung Fu. You are urged to find a local trainer and begin 
your study of Martial Arts as quickly as possible. Mastering Kung Fu is the only 
way for you to survive the harsh realities of The Land.<br>
Once you have learned some Kung Fu, it is time to join a clan, seek a master, 
and begin your real training. There are nine major clans in The land, each based 
on actual historical clans. However, there are only six that new disciples can 
join, which include: The League of Beggars, Shaolin, Wu-Tang Clan, Heavenly 
Demon, The Brotherhood of Thieves and Sacred Flower. Disciples who have achieved 
a certain level of mastery can later seek to join three advanced clans, which 
include: The Union of Noble Families, The Disciples of Iron Fist and Black 
Dragon Clan.
