Refining a weapon with special raw materials can raise that weapon's basic 
stats.<br>
<br>
For a price, a skilled craftsman can take a normal weapon and craft it into a 
superior weapon with additional capabilities. The extent of these changes vary 
by weapon type.<br>

<br>
The Master Refiner is Mo Tailan, who runs his own refinement shop in Heifei.<br>
<br>
To have Mo Tailan refine a weapon for you, you should bring her the required fee 
and the requested materials. The more you refine a weapon the higher the quality 
of materials you will need. Most materials can be acquired by trading Blood 
Essence (sometimes referred to as The Blood of The Dragon) to merchants who 
carry refinement materials. Mo Tailan will tell you what she requires. <br>
<br>
Know that there is a risk to refinement, even with a craftsman as skilled as Mo 
Tailan. There is a small chance that the weapon will be destroyed in the 
process. However, if Mo Tailan succeeds, your weapon will become far more 
powerful.<br>
<br>
If you refine a weapon to a very high level with Dragon's Blood it will generate 
a powerful aura of illumination.<br>

¨ç<b> Refinement of Normal Weapons</b><br>
The advantage of attempting to refine normal weapons is that they have a higher 
success rate and lower chance of being destroyed. However, even if they are 
refined many times to maximize their attack power, their basic properites never 
change. Their advantage also makes them less valuable than other types of 
weapons.<br>
<br>
¨è<b> Refinement of Precious Items and Artifacts</b><br>
Precious items are more difficult to refine than normal items, but they can be 
refined with the same materials. These are much more valuable because they often 
gain additional functions after refinement.<br>
<br>
¨é<b> Other Weapons</b><br>
Weapons that bear the names of famous people are precious items. It would be 
unfortunate to destroy such a special weapon by risking refinement, but it also 
presents an opportunity to create a truly unique weapon.<br>
<br>
¨ê<b> Items that Cannot Be Refined</b><br>
Refiners will not refine weapons that are already very powerful or rare. It is 
an unwritten law between refiners because they fear that they might accidentally 
destroy a precious weapon. None of them wish to risk the disgrace of destroying 
a famous weapon.<br>
Additionally, high level items may have already achieved their maximum power.<br>
Talk to the refiner to find out if a weapon can be refined.<br>
<br>
<b>Refinement Material</b><br>
Refinement materials are made from the careful extraction of Blood Essence. Give 
Blood Essence to a merchant and he will trade you the materials you require.<br>
Although it is rare, you may find Blood Essence carried by disciples of Deviant 
Clans.<br>
