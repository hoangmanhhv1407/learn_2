<br><font size=4pt>¡¡</font><font size=8pt> Deviant Clan disciples are aggressive 
NPCs. They may attack alone or in groups.<br>
If you are engaged in combat with a Deviant Clan Disciple it is worth 
understanding that they have their own Kung Fu techniques and varying degrees of 
mastery. This allows you to detect their strengths and weaknesses and develop 
your own tactics against it.<br>
<br>
Deviant Clan incidents can range from a single large monster of the Beast 
Clan to several dozen disciples of various rank from a clan like Secret Shadows.<br>
<br>
<font size=4pt>¡¡</font>Usually, Deviant Clans are enemies of all players, but 
there are some special circumstances where they may become allies.<br>
Deviant Clans have many factions and most of them are in opposition with 
one another. If you are ever in trouble this knowledge can be used to good 
effect. Deviant Clans will sometimes choose to fight against each other rather 
than against you.<br>
There are many Deviant Clans fighting for dominance in The Land to fill 
the power vaccum that arose in the aftermath of The War of Nine Dragons. 
Currently, the greatest threats to the well-being of The Land are the Secret 
Shadow Clan, Death Valley Clan, Valley of Hell Clan, Beast Clan, and The Clan of 
Golden Coins.<br><br>
